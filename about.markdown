I work on problems in decentralized finance and machine learning. Currently, I am Co-Founder and Head of Research at [Odos](https://odos.xyz), where I work on algorithms and infrastructure for optimal trade routing. Since launch, Odos has processed over $100 billion in trading volume for more than 3 million users. Previously, I conducted applied machine learning research, with a focus on reinforcement learning and transformer-based models.
